# Encryption-Decryption-App
Ecrypt and Decrypt texts with both symmetric and asymmetric algorithms
I have created a system for encryption and decryption of messages
by using both symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption.
For symmetric, I used base-64 and RSA for asymmetric.

#To run base_64_EN_DE_with_tkinterGUI
-pip install tkinter 
-pip install base64
Note : If tkinter doesn't work
       Create studysession file and activate.

#To run rsa_EN_DE_with_tkinterGUI
-pip install tkinter
-pip install pycryptodome
Note : If crypto library doesn't work after installing
     C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Lib\site-packages\Crypto
       Copy the whole crypto file and paste in your project file.

#To run email_SMTP
-pip install smtplib
-pip install ssl
- replace the sender and receiver emails.
- generate app password from google account.
- turn on 2-factor authentication.
- myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
- Name the app python.
-  it would generate password automatically.
- replace in the source code.
Note : only use stable internet connection to run smtp smoothly.
